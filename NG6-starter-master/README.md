### Gulp Tasks
Here's a list of available tasks:
* `webpack`
  * runs Webpack, which will transpile, concatenate, and compress (collectively, "bundle") all assets and modules into `dist/bundle.js`. It also prepares `index.html` to be used as application entry point, links assets and created dist version of our application.
* `serve`
  * starts a dev server via `webpack-dev-server`, serving the client folder.
* `watch`
  * alias of `serve`
* `default` (which is the default task that runs when typing `gulp` without providing an argument)
	* runs `serve`.
* `component`
  * scaffolds a new Angular component. [Read below](#generating-components) for usage details.
  
### Testing
To run the tests, run `npm test` or `karma start`.

`Karma` combined with Webpack runs all files matching `*.spec.js` inside the `app` folder. This allows us to keep test files local to the component--which keeps us in good faith with continuing to build our app modularly. The file `spec.bundle.js` is the bundle file for **all** our spec files that Karma will run.

Be sure to define your `*.spec.js` files within their corresponding component directory. You must name the spec file like so, `[name].spec.js`. If you don't want to use the `.spec.js` suffix, you must change the `regex` in `spec.bundle.js` to look for whatever file(s) you want.
`Mocha` is the testing suite and `Chai` is the assertion library. If you would like to change this, see `karma.conf.js`.

### Examples

It's always easier to learn something if you have an examples. Here is a list of repos which based on this starter:

### Generating Components
Following a consistent directory structure between components offers us the certainty of predictability. We can take advantage of this certainty by creating a gulp task to automate the "instantiation" of our components. The component boilerplate task generates this:
```
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName/
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.js // entry file where all its dependencies load
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.component.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.controller.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.html
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.styl // scoped to affect only its own template
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.spec.js // contains passing demonstration tests
```

You may, of course, create these files manually, every time a new module is needed, but that gets quickly tedious.
To generate a component, run `gulp component --name componentName`.

The parameter following the `--name` flag is the name of the component to be created. Ensure that it is unique or it will overwrite the preexisting identically-named component.

The component will be created, by default, inside `client/app/components`. To change this, apply the `--parent` flag, followed by a path relative to `client/app/components/`.

For example, running `gulp component --name signup --parent auth` will create a `signup` component at `client/app/components/auth/signup`.  

Running `gulp component --name footer --parent ../common` creates a `footer` component at `client/app/common/footer`.  

Because the argument to `--name` applies to the folder name **and** the actual component name, make sure to camelcase the component names.
